# PNWScala

This is the code for the PNWScala website. It's just raw code, at the moment. We should probably use a static site generator at some point. One day....

To preview the website, run `rake serve`. To deploy, run `rake deploy`.

## Notes:

For whatever it's worth, the design for the 2014 website is based on the template here (which I paid for, of course -- it's worth every cent)! --> [http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB02332JB](http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB02332JB)
